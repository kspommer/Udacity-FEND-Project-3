===============================

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).

INTRODUCTION 
Welcome to the new game of life. As a player, you will navigate the course of life,  
working to protect your heat from being crushed by one of the rocks of life. 

HOW TO RUN THE GAME 
Double click on the index.html file to launch the game in a browser. 

HOW TO PLAY THE GAME 
Using the arrow keys, the player's goal is to navigate their heart to the water 
without being crushed by a life rock.  

If hit by a life rock, the player's heart will experience a setback and is 
returned to the starting point and the game continues. 

When the player's heart reaches the water's edge, they win the game.

Upon a win, the player can elect to restart the game or close the browser to end the game.
